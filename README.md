# Hi there, welcome to my profile!

<img align="right" width="300em" height="300em" src="https://github.com/mateusjbarbosa/mateusjbarbosa/blob/master/avatar.png"/>

I currently work as a Software Engineer at FindMe, where I act with Node.js, React and React Native. I also work as Backend Node.js Educator at Digital House Brasil.

From a very early age, I'm concerned about the quality in which products and services are delivered to consumers, not only in the technological world, but also in the everyday world, the famous UX of things.

My professional goal is to be recognized as a developer “from the ground up to the finish” in the digital world, or, as said in the market, a FullCycle Developer, managing to participate in all stages of the application development process.
